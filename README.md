###  **A Big Data Analytics Capstone Project on Finance**


##  Overview

This repository presents my **MBA Capstone Project** on *Big Data Analytics in Banking*.
It includes **five real-world machine learning use cases**, each implemented and visualized in **Databricks** using Python and SQL.

The goal of this project is to demonstrate how **data-driven insights** can help banks make better strategic and operational decisions — reducing fraud, improving customer satisfaction, and optimizing resource allocation.

| 4️ | **Customer Segmentation**       | Cluster customers by behavior               | K-Means Clustering                 |
| 5️ | **Credit Card Fraud Detection** | Detect fraudulent card transactions         | Random Forest, Oversampling        |


##  Tools & Technologies

* **Platform:** Databricks
* **Programming Languages:** Python, SQL
* **Libraries:** `Pandas`, `NumPy`, `Scikit-learn`, `Matplotlib`, `Seaborn`
* **Visualization:** Databricks Dashboards & Python plots
* **Machine Learning Methods:** Classification, Clustering, Forecasting


##  Key Insights

* **Customer Churn:** Identified top factors influencing churn — tenure, balance, and inactivity.
* **ATM Forecasting:** Improved accuracy in predicting daily cash withdrawals.
* **Loan Fraud:** Detected 90% of fraudulent applications using Random Forest.
* **Customer Segmentation:** Grouped customers into 4 actionable segments.
* **Credit Card Fraud:** Achieved 95% fraud detection accuracy (AUC Score: 0.95).


##  Methodology

Each use case follows a consistent **Data Science workflow**:

1. **Data Collection & Cleaning** – Prepare and preprocess raw data.
2. **EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis)** – Understand trends and correlations.
3. **Feature Engineering** – Encode categorical variables and scale numerical ones.
4. **Model Building & Evaluation** – Train, test, and optimize ML models.
5. **Visualization & Insights** – Create dashboards for business interpretation.


##  Results Summary

1. Improved decision-making through data insights
2. Automated detection of fraud and churn risks
3. Enhanced operational efficiency for ATMs
4. Personalized strategies for customer engagement
